# Good Will Charity

### Problem Statement
“Transparency and Genuine Charity System”
The traditional charitable donation system lacks transparency and accountability, resulting in a lack of trust and inhibiting widespread contributions to meaningful causes. Donors often face challenges in precisely tracking their donations, ensuring efficient fund allocation, and verifying the actual impact of their contributions. Charitable organizations struggle to prove their legitimacy and showcase their projects' true impact to donors, leading to a lack of trust.

Moreover, the existing approval and evaluation processes for charitable projects are often centralized and lack community involvement. This centralization limits the inclusivity and diverse perspectives required for effective decision-making. Additionally, the absence of a standardized, decentralized, and technologically advanced platform inhibits the seamless interaction between donors and charitable organizations.

The need of the hour is to leverage Web3.0 technologies, specifically blockchain and smart contracts, to create a "Transparency and Genuine Charity System" like "Good-will-charity". This initiative aims to address the aforementioned issues by offering a transparent, accountable, and decentralized platform that facilitates efficient donation tracking, precise fund disbursement, and real-time impact showcasing. It strives to instill trust and encourage broader participation in charitable activities for the betterment of society.

### Requirements of the Project
 - **Solidity Web3**
	* Solidity provides Inheritance properties in contracts including multiple level inheritance properties.
 - **Metamask**
	* To have an easy-to-use and secure wallet service, the platform connects to users' MetaMask automatically.
 - **Node.js**
	* Node.js is used a backend for our application. It records transactions communicates between the Applications and integrates frontend.
 - **Ganache**
	* Ganache provides the GUI-based local Ethereum blockchain development environment to deploy and test contracts.

### Project Working
* A metamask connection is required to run the application for any transaction.
* A ganache RPC Server is run with metamask as the wallet, using the node.js interface.
* Charity and organisation details are saved in the application, and a hash value is generated
* A transaction is carried out, between organisation and charity and transaction hash is generated for each transaction
* A block is created, when the user mines all the transactions updates.
